# to_html

to_html is my hobby project that aims to generate an html equivalent of somewhat markdown like language

# Thinking behind the project

```
 #Hello;         -> <h1> Hello </h1>
 ##Hello;        -> <h2> Hello </h2> 
 ...
 ######Hello;    -> <h6> Hello </h6>

 img(https://somepic.com/pic,random picture, 600, 800); -> <img src = "https://somepic.com/pic" alt = "random picture" height = "600" width = "800"/>

```
